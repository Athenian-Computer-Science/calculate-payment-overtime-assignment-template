# Calculate payment with overtime

## Problem Description
You have already completed an assignemnt to calculate a person's weekly pay. However, that assignment did not include any overtime pay. In this assignment, you will account for overtime.

* The hourly wage is 16.50 per hour for the first 40 hours
* Overtime pay is "time and a half" - in other words, the hourly amount plus an additional 50%.

## Example
```
Hours worked? 40
660

Hours worked? 50
907.50
```

## Suggested Approach
1) Work out the logic *before* you start typing.
2) Be sure to test different conditions (less than 40 hours worked, 40 hours worked, more than 40 hours worked). Your program should work for all of them.

## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
